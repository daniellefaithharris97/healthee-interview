# PRD: Internal Feedback Tool

## Introduction/Overview

The Internal Feedback Tool is a lightweight web application designed to collect, store, and summarize feedback from the CS team. The tool addresses the need for a centralized place to gather team input and generate AI-powered summaries of collected feedback. The goal is to create a simple, intuitive interface that allows team members to submit feedback, view previous submissions, and generate summaries without requiring authentication or complex setup.

## Goals

1. Provide a centralized location for CS team feedback collection
2. Enable easy submission of feedback with a 500-word limit
3. Display feedback history in a clear, readable format
4. Allow deletion of individual feedback entries
5. Generate AI-powered summaries of all collected feedback
6. Ensure data persistence across browser sessions
7. Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messaging

## User Stories

- **As a CS team member**, I want to submit feedback through a simple form so that I can share my thoughts and concerns with the team
- **As a CS team member**, I want to see a list of all previous feedback submissions so that I can review what has been shared
- **As a CS team member**, I want to delete my feedback submissions so that I can remove outdated or incorrect information
- **As a CS team member**, I want to generate a summary of all feedback so that I can quickly understand the key themes and insights
- **As a CS team member**, I want my feedback to be saved permanently so that it remains available after closing the browser

## Functional Requirements

1. **Feedback Submission Interface**
   - The system must display an input box at the top of the screen for feedback entry
   - The system must include a submit button to process feedback submissions
   - The system must display clear instructions that feedback should be under 500 words
   - The system must prevent typing when the 500-word limit is reached
   - The system must validate that feedback is not empty before submission

2. **Feedback Display**
   - The system must display all submitted feedback in a list format
   - The system must show the first 10 words of each feedback entry
   - The system must display the date and time when each feedback was submitted
   - The system must order feedback entries with the most recent first

3. **Feedback Management**
   - The system must provide a delete button (trash icon) for each feedback entry
   - The system must remove feedback from the database when delete is clicked
   - The system must update the display immediately after deletion

4. **AI Summary Feature**
   - The system must display a "Summarize" button in the top right corner of the feedback list
   - The system must generate an AI summary when the button is clicked
   - The system must display "API unavailable" message when the AI service is not accessible
   - The system must show the summary in a clear, readable format

5. **Data Persistence**
   - The system must store all feedback in a SQL database
   - The system must maintain data across browser sessions and page refreshes
   - The system must handle database connection errors gracefully

6. **Error Handling**
   - The system must display user-friendly error messages for all error conditions
   - The system must handle network failures gracefully
   - The system must validate input before processing

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- User authentication or login systems
- Role-based access control or permissions
- External deployment or cloud integration
- Real-time collaboration features
- Feedback categorization or tagging
- User profiles or personalization
- Advanced search or filtering capabilities
- Email notifications or alerts

## Design Considerations

- **Layout**: Input box at top, feedback list below, summarize button in top right of list area
- **Input Box**: Large text area with character counter showing "X/500 words"
- **Feedback List**: Clean list format with first 10 words, timestamp, and delete icon
- **Delete Button**: Small trash icon on the right side of each feedback entry
- **Summary Button**: Prominent button in top right corner of the feedback list area
- **Responsive Design**: Should work on desktop and mobile devices
- **Error Messages**: Clear, non-technical language for all error states

## Technical Considerations

- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity and ease of setup
- **Backend**: Simple REST API with endpoints for CRUD operations
- **Frontend**: Modern web framework (React/Vue.js) for responsive UI
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for summary generation (to be implemented later)
- **Data Model**: Simple table with id, text, timestamp columns
- **Validation**: Client-side and server-side input validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all operations

## Success Metrics

- CS team members can successfully submit feedback without technical issues
- Feedback persists across browser sessions
- AI summary generation works when API is available
- Error messages are clear and helpful to users
- The tool is intuitive enough for non-technical users to operate
